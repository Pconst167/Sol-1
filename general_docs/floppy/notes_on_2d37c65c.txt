Also, check out the National 8473, and the SMC37C65x family. A second
source for the WD37C65 is Goldstar, who made a pin compatible version.


I don't reccomend the 37C65 as it requires some nasty components; two
sryctals, one of which is an odball freq., and four silver/mica caps.
Also, you need to put 100ohm resistors in series with the TC, and IRQ
lines that drive the bus. These pins have 48ma drivers on them, and
they generate a LOT of ground bounce.

The National part uses a single 24 mhz cyrstal, or oscillator module,
and only a couple of simple crystals. The National part is also pin
compatible with the Intel part. I think the old Intel part # was 8277?

For new parts, I would use the National 8477, or the Intel 82077AA,
THese parts can handle the new 2.88mb floppy drives that never quite
got popular. They can also do perpendicular recording.
