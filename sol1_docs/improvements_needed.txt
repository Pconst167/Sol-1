1. internal bus / alu need to be 16 bits wide with options to still deal with 8bit halves of registers
2. address registers such as bp, sp, etc need to be connected directly to the external address bus
via a multiplexer, so that when these address registers are used, they do not need to first be copied into MAR.

3. microcode roms need a state machine that will allow their re-programming without removing the chips from the boards.
this could be done by adding a slot for a ROM chip that will contain the entire microcode, and then copying
the microcode from that ROM into the microcode ROMS.

4. program counter, MAR, SP, etc need a dedicated ALU or adder so that we do not need to use the ALU for
updating these registers. using the alu consumes clock cycles.
