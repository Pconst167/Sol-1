These files are my small-C cross-compiler system for CP/M from DOS.
I use them for cross-compiling editor sources for unknown CP/M boxes
of my favorite CP/M editor, Ed Reams famous Dr. Dobbs' ``Red'' editor.
The sources have been hacked to conform to my tastes so they are not
exactly as Ed's sources were, but are pretty close.  I tailored it to
my tastes and they may not be what others like.  Ed's final sources
are in one of the CUG volumes, as released for the IBM PC.  The red
sources for CP/M I got from Ed, back about 1984 or so.  Since he
long ago released the sources, I am passing along the CP/M versions
(my hacks), here for testing the cross-compiler, and for anyone that
wants to port a good editor to another variant of CP/M.  I have included
my version of the source for red for a Heath/Zenith H-19 style terminal
(VT-52).  Also included are my Televideo sources that I used to use
on my old Televideo TS-802 boxes.

Invoke the cross-compiler and assembler and linker just as in the
doc files or as you would on a CP/M box.

The CP/M emulator included with this came from the CP/M archives.
The files marked with the .CPM extension are actual CP/M files that
can be run under the emulator as a cross-compiler or to check what
the dos version does.

Good Luck.
