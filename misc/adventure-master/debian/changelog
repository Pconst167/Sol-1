advent (4.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Update README and manual to focus on the story and game, the origin
    has its own place and need not be repeated everywhere.  Lead with
    the classic game intro.
  * Add map.jpg from https://rickadams.org/adventure/e_downloads.html
  * Fix out-of-bounds problems reported in issue #2
    * Some of these fixes affect game play, e.g. moving things should now
      actually work, in particular for "odd" objects.  (What isn't odd in
      the Colossal Cave?)
  * Fix lots of other out-of-bounds issues found by Coverity Scan
  * Log save game filename in error and status messages
