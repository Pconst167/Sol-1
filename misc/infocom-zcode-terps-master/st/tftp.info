TFTP FOR ATARI ST
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE: before running TFTP, make /sure/ the ST was booted with
the disk labeled Boot Disk, or any disk that installs the four standard
desk accessories.  This will ensure that the serial port is set up
correctly.

    To use the ST TFTP, just connect a DEC20 line to the serial port.
No special cables needed.  The baud rate defaults to 9600 but can be
changed through the "Set RS232 Config" desk accessory.

    There are two versions of the TFTP around.  The only difference
is that the first always creates a file called STORY.DAT on the same disk
as the TFTP itself, whereas the second allows you to specify the name
of the file and the disk it is written to.
