HOW TO MAKE A MASTER GAME DISK FOR THE MACINTOSH
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For this procedure, you will need three disks:

    []  a blank disk
    []  the Mac Create disk  (Game, DiskUtil, Set File, Examine File)
    []  the Mac Utility disk  (TFTP, Masterize)

  1.  Create a new game disk by copying the entire Create disk onto the
blank disk.  The recommended copier is DiskUtil (or another sector copier), 
since using the Finder copier changes the desktop arrangement.  Eject 
both disks, put away the Create disk and reboot.

  2.  Put the Utility disk in Drive 1 and the new game disk in Drive 2.  
Rename the game disk and game file  (e.g. "Game Disk" becomes "ZORK I Disk"
and "Game" becomes "ZORK I").

  3.  Run the TFTP program [*].  When a directory box appears, click on the 
Drive button to show the game disk directory.  Select the game file and click
on the Open button.  Set up the DEC 20, then press any key to start receiving.
The download should take less than five minutes.

      [*] For TFTP, a special Mac TFTP cable, with pin 20 cut, is required, 
plus a modem eliminator cable.

  4.  Run the Hancock program to signaturize the disk.  When it asks for 
a code, use the two-character Production Department code for the game you
are making (e.g., Z1, M3, S4, etc -- a full list is on our Order Forms).

  5.  Use the Get Info menu command to Lock the game file against
accidental deletion.

  6.  If this game has a special boot screen, copy it to the game disk.
Always rename it as StartUpScreen.

  7.  Throw away the Production folder on the game disk, and empty the
trash.  The game disk should be left in the "opened" position on the desktop.
From the File menu, eject both disks from the machine.
