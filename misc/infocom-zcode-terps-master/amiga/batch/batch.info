HOW TO BUILD THE COMMODORE AMIGA ZIP/EZIP  (USING BATCH FILES)
--------------------------------------------------------------

    The Amiga development tools currently run on the micro group's Compaq.

  [] Enter the /EDIT directory

  [] BZA	(assemble 68K source)
			(make sure flag in source is set for ZIP or EZIP)

  [] BZCNOS	(compile C source, two phases)
			(make sure flag in batch file is set for ZIP or EZIP)

  [] BZLNOS	(link, "No Symbols" -- no debugging info)

  [] BZHEX	(hexify the .LD file)

  [] run "READ zipXX serial" on the Amiga

  [] run XTALK on the PC:

	sp 9600
	go local
	<home>
	send ZIP.HEX

Possible alternate to last three steps -- [dbb 9/26/86]

  (On Amiga)  READ ram:file serial
  (On PC)  CONVERT < file.ld > AUX	(hexify, output directly to port)

  (On Amiga)  LIST ram:file
  (On PC)  DIR file.ld			(compare lengths)

HOW TO CREATE LIST FILES
------------------------

  []	BZALST	(for 68K, creates ZIP.LIS)

  []	BZC
	BZOMD AMIGAZIP   (for C, creates AMIGAZIP.LIS)

	A problem with BZC is it causes a subsequent link attempt to fail
	(error 21, whatever that means).
