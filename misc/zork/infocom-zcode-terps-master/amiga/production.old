How to download a game to the Amiga (via a PC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Transfer the game file to the PC with Kermit.

2.  CONVERT < GAME.ZIP > GAME.HEX	(hexify it)

3.  SPLIT GAME.HEX 100000 Q		(split into smaller files)

4.  On the Amiga, make a disk copy of the Create disk

	Open the CLI on the Workbench disk
	>diskcopy from df0: to df1:

    A prompt appears, put Create disk in drive 0 and an unformatted
    disk in drive 1 (format is automatic).  Hit RETURN.

5.  (Repeat the following once for each file created in Step 3)

    On Amiga:  (Workbench disk is still in drive 0, CLI is open)

	Put Transfer Disk in drive 1.
	>cd df1:			(change to Transfer Disk)
	>read Game.00x serial		(x is 1, 2, or 3)

    On the PC:

	XTALK
	sp 96				(speed 9600)
	go lo				(go local)
	<HOME>				(hit the home key, #7 on right)
	se GAME.00x			(send a file)
	quit				(when done)

6.  On Amiga:   (when drive lights go out)

	Remove Workbench disk, insert copy of Create disk in drive 0.

	>join Game.001 Game.002 Game.003 AS df0:Story.Data

7.  On Amiga:   (when drive lights go out)

	Remove Transfer disk, insert Workbench disk in drive 1.

	>protect df0:Story.Data r	(make the game READ-ONLY)

8.  Remove the new game disk ond open the Write-Protect tab.
