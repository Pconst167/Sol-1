How to make a master Amiga game disk
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:  When removing a disk from an Amiga disk drive, always wait 
several seconds and watch the red access light to make sure the system
is done with it.

Under AmigaDOS (the CLI or Command Line Interpreter), the internal drive
is "df0:" and the external is "df1:".


1.  Make a copy of the Amiga Create disk.  It's not necessary to format
    the blank disk, as this happens automatically.

    The copy can be done within CLI by typing "diskcopy from df0: to df1:"
    and following the prompts, or from Workbench by just dragging disk icons.

2.  Run TFTP.   See the note TFTP.INFO.

3.  Make the data file READ-ONLY:

	Remove TFTP disk, and insert Workbench disk in drive 0.

	>protect df1:Story.Data r

4.  Rename the game disk (e.g., Zork 1 Disk) and the interpreter file 
    (e.g., Zork 1).

5.  Remove the finished disk ond open the Write-Protect tab.
