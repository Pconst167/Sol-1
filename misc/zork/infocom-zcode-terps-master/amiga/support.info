Amiga problems, additional information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM

    "When I run the story and try to change the window size, it crashes."

DIAGNOSIS

    User probably has a 256K Amiga (the basic model) and is running out of 

memory.  Opening or resizing any window (or hiding certain windows like the 

story's) temporarily uses a lot of memory.  

    When memory is too low to comply, these actions SHOULD just be ignored.  

Because of a bug in Amiga, sometimes they cause a crash.  

FIX

    Don't change the window, or upgrade to 512K.

-------

PROBLEM

    "RESTORE says it can't locate my save file."

DIAGNOSIS

    Careful of sub-directories (folders).  If you started the story

from within a sub-directory, save files will be put, by default, into the

same sub-directory.  If you save to a second disk and later want to 

restore from the first, you must explicitly specify the sub-directory.

FIX

    Prefix the name of the restore file with a full pathname.

For example, "df0:Gamedir/Savefile.Save" specifies the internal drive

and the Gamedir subdirectory (yes, with a forward slash).

-------

PROBLEM

    "When I type the story name into the CLI, it says 'unknown command'

or 'Story file open error'."

DIAGNOSIS

    The story disk is not in the default drive.  Or the story file is in

a subdirectory which is not the default.  The story name has to be typed into

the CLI (command line interpreter) without any drive or directory prefixes.

(For example, "df1:Zork1" will fail.)

FIX

    Use the "cd" command to change the default drive/directory first.  

For example, "cd df1:" if the story disk is in the external drive.  Or move 

the disk to the default drive.

-------

PROBLEM

    Run two games (or same game twice), when I quit the second one the

machine crashes.

DIAGNOSIS

    Bug.

FIX

    Works in interpreter releases higher that 'A'.

-------

PROBLEM

    Says "Not enough available memory" or "Memory block allocation error."

DIAGNOSIS/FIX

    In the first case, the story isn't finding the minimum amount of memory

it needs to load.  You can free up memory by quitting any other programs

that may be running, and by closing all unnecessary windows.  Or, you can

make more memory available with the "F/" option (see refcard section X).

TO MAXIMIZE THE MEMORY AVAILABLE TO THE STORY, START IT WITH "F/2000."

    In the second case, the story is finding enough free memory, but it's

"fragmented" (not in one block).  This can be caused moving things around

on the desktop, or by opening and closing windows, or by running a program

that doesn't completely "clean up" after itself.  If the fixes for the first 

case don't work, try rebooting the machine.

-------

PROBLEM

    "When I click on an icon for a save file, an error message says 

'No default tool for this icon.'"

DIAGNOSIS/FIX

    The desktop icon for a save file is useful for copying the file 

to another disk or deleting it, but the interpreter doesn't support 

clicking it to start the game from the saved position, a la Macintosh.

To restore a saved file, user must first start the game in the

usual way, and then type RESTORE.
