    The most recent Macintosh ZIP/EZIP sources are on the Lisa
Workshop hard disk, in the pseudo-directory (that is, prefixed by)
"cp/" (meaning consumer products; compare with "bp/").  There is also
a backup copy on Lisa-format floppies.

    The Mac directory on the DEC20 may not be up to date, as there's
no direct means of transferring files from the Lisa.  (It can be done 
from a Mac with Kermit.)
