MAC SIGNATURES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Macintosh interpreter, as of version D, should have associated
with it a UNIQUE (for each game) "signature" and "file type."  These 
four-character strings are used for two purposes:

[]  by the Finder, to link a document (save file) with the application
    that created it.  

[]  by the File Selector filtering function (during a Restore), to
    display names of save documents only.


    The generic signature & file type (used in sources and by MACCOM)
are INFO & ZSAV.  They occur in the following numbers and locations.

		INFO			ZSAV
		--------		--------
GAME file	1 - Pascal code		1 - Pascal code
		2 - resource		1 - resource
					1 - 68K code

DESKTOP file	2 times			1 time

volume direc	1 time
		--------		--------
TOTALS		6			4


    The generic strings should be replaced from among those listed
below.  Since the interpreter is otherwise identical from game to
game, the easiest way to accomplish this change is to use a disk editor
to patch each create disk, preferably just before running TFTP.

    The following strings are registered exclusively to Infocom in
a database which is maintained by Macintosh tech support.  Contact Bill
Dawson at (408) 973-3400 if more are needed.

	INA0 to INA9	and	ZSA0 to ZSA9	(Tales of Adventure)
	INM0 to INM9	and	ZSM0 to ZSM9	(Mystery)
	INS0 to INS9	and	ZSS0 to ZSS9	(Science Fiction)
	INZ0 to INZ9	and	ZSZ0 to ZSZ9	(Zork etc)

    The last two letters correspond directly to Production Department
inventory codes for each game.  

    Also registered are INFO, ZSAV, and INFB (Infobase).
