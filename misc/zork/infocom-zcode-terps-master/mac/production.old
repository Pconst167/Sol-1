HOW TO MAKE A MASTER GAME DISK FOR THE MACINTOSH
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For this procedure, you will need three disks:

    []  a blank disk
    []  the Mac Create disk  (Game, DiskUtil, Set File, Examine File)
    []  the Mac Utility disk  (TFTP, Masterize)

  1.  Create a new game disk by copying the entire Create disk onto the
blank disk.  The recommended copier is DiskUtil (or another sector copier), 
since using the Finder copier changes the desktop.  Eject both disks, 
put away the Create disk and reboot.

  2.  Put the Utility disk in Drive 1 and the new game disk in Drive 2.  
Rename the game disk and game file  (e.g. "Game Disk" becomes "ZORK I Disk"
and "Game" becomes "ZORK I").

  3.  Run the TFTP program.  When a directory box appears, click on the 
Drive button to show the game disk directory.  Select the game file and click
on the Open button.  Set up the DEC 20, then press any key to start receiving.
The download should take less than five minutes.

  4.  Give the disk to me (DBB).  I will patch in some signature data
(different for each game).

  5.  Run the Masterize program.  When a directory box appears, click on the 
Drive button to show the game disk directory.  Select the game file and click 
on the Open button.  If all is well, the program will say 'Okay'.

  CAUTION:  Masterize creates a special file on the game disk which marks it
  as a Master disk.  The file, Z.DAT, uses a non-standard disk format and
  can't be copied by normal means.  Trying to copy it or deleting it can leave 
  damaged sectors on the game disk.  The next two steps prevent users from 
  doing this accidentally.

  6.  Run the Set File program.  Set the Z.DAT file as Locked and Invisible, 
and the game file as Locked, then click on the Quit button.

  7.  Run the Examine File program.  From the Misc menu select Copy Protect.  
When a directory box appears, select the Z.DAT file and click on the Open
button.  The program will ask if you are sure; answer yes.  From the File menu 
select Quit.

  8.  If this game has a special boot screen, copy it to the game disk.
It should always be named StartUpScreen.

  9.  Throw away the Production folder on the game disk, and empty the
trash.  The game disk should be left in the "opened" position on the desktop.
From the File menu, eject both disks from the machine.
