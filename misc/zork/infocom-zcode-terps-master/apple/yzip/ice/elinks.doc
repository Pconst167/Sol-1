       IBM PC/XT/AT SYMBOLIC DEBUG COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE
                    FOR PC-DOS v2.x AND v3.x


Supplied on the IBM compatible disk are two files:

ELINKS.EXE - Executable Communications Software program which 
             uses the IBM-PC/XT/AT COM1 or COM2 port.

ELINKS.DOC - This document.


     If it is required that an I/O port other than a standard IBM 
COM1 or COM2 port be used, contact Huntsville Microsystems, Inc.



Starting ELINKS:

     The standard ELINKS command line is formatted as follows:

          ELINKS [-baud] [-port] [<hexfile> [<symfile>] ]

     All command line arguments are optional.


     -baud     Select   communications  port  baud   rate   (9600 
               default).  Allowable selections are:  N (No change 
               from current baud rate), 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 
               2400, 4800, 9600.

     -port     Select   communications  port.    (COM1  or   COM2 
               default).   ELINKS will automatically select  COM1 
               as its default,  unless COM1 is not available,  in 
               which  case  it will use COM2.   The -port  option 
               will override this port search and cause ELINKS to 
               use  only the port named.   Allowable options are:  
               AUX (Default -- may be COM1 or COM2), COM1, COM2.

     <hexfile> Set  up the name of a .HEX file to load  with  the 
               emulator  'R' command,  or write with the emulator 
               'W'  command.   The hex file name is of the  form:  
               [d:][path]filename[.ext]  .    The  file's  drive, 
               path, and extent are all optional.  Drive and path 
               default  to  the  currently  logged-in  drive  and 
               directory.  A hexfile's extent defaults to .HEX .

     <symfile> Read the named symbol file into the ELINKS  symbol 
               table.  The symbol file must be in standard symbol 
               file  format,   such  as  that  produced  by   the 
               Huntsville  Microsystem's  HMA  series  of  cross-
               assemblers.   The  symbol file name is of the same 
               form as a hex file name:  [d:][path]filename[.ext]  
               Drive and path default as before.  Extent defaults 
               to .SYM for a symbol file.

Notes:

     To  use  ELINKS,  the  HMI emulator should  be  set  up  for 
autobaud mode with 8 data bits and no parity (this is how  ELINKS 
sets  up  the  COMx port).   The CTS and RTS  control  lines  are 
ignored  by  ELINKS,  and should be jumpered together inside  the 
emulator.

     When ELINKS is started,  it will sign-on and ask:   "Has the 
emulator been reset (Y or N) ?  ".  If the emulator has just been 
turned  on,  or  if the emulator's reset button has been  pressed 
since  last using ELINKS,  this question should be answered  'Y'.  
Otherwise,  it  should  be answered 'N'.   A 'Y' answer  to  this 
question causes ELINKS to initialize the emulator's baud rate and 
communications software handshake mode.

     To exit ELINKS, use the 'Ctrl-Break' key.


Examples:
          ELINKS                        ; Run ELINKS
          ELINKS -4800                  ; Set baud rate to 4800
          ELINKS -COM2                  ; Use COM2
          ELINKS TEST                   ; Set up "TEST.HEX"
          ELINKS TEST.HXE               ; Set up "TEST.HXE"
          ELINKS TEST TEST              ; Read "TEST.SYM"
          ELINKS TEST TEST.             ; Read "TEST."
          ELINKS -1200 -COM1 TEST TEST  ; All options used



ELINKS commands:

     Using  ELINKS  in conjunction with an HMI emulator adds  the 
following commands to the emulator's command set:

     I   hexfile         ; Set up a hex file name for 
                         ; reading/writing
     R                   ; Read a hex file set up with 'I'
     R   bias            ; Read a hex file with offset 'bias'
     W   saddr,faddr     ; Write a hex file from 'saddr' to 
                         ; 'faddr' into the 'I' file
     DIR                 ; Show disk directory
     <   batfile         ; Read emulator commands from the file 
                         ; 'batfile'
     +   outfile         ; Send all screen output to the file 
                         ; 'outfile'
     I.  symfile         ; Read the given symbol file
     I.. symfile         ; Append the given symbol file
     W.  symfile         ; Write the ELINKS symbol table to the 
                         ; named file
     .                   ; Display the ELINKS symbol table
     .symbol             ; Display the ELINKS symbol table, 
                         ; starting at 'symbol'
     .symbol=            ; Delete the named symbol from the 
                         ; ELINKS symbol table
     .symbol=value       ; Create or revalue the named symbol


     In  addition  to  adding the commands  listed,  ELINKS  will 
insert  symbols  into  the output of all  'L'  commands  and  CPU 
register displays.

     When  ELINKS is in use,  all emulator commands which require 
addresses may have symbols used in place of the address(es).   To 
use a symbol in a command in place of an address,  use  ".symbol" 
where the address is required.

Examples:
          L100           ; List from 0100
          L.START        ; List from START
          W.START,.END   ; Write from START to END



Details on ELINKS commands:


     I hexfile

          The  'I' command is used to name a hex file for  ELINKS 
to use on subsequent 'R' and 'W' commands.

          The  hex  file name is given using standard  file  name 
format.  ".HEX" is the default file name extension.

          The  initial  'I' filename can be given on  the  ELINKS 
command line.


     R
     R bias

          The  'R' command is used for reading the last named 'I' 
file into the emulator or target system memory.   If a read  bias 
is  given,  this bias will be added to the addresses of all bytes 
read from the hex file, before these bytes are stored in memory.

          'bias' is a hexadecimal number (or symbol).


     W saddr,faddr

          The 'W' command is used to write a hex file from  saddr 
to faddr into the last named 'I' file.

          'saddr'   and  'faddr'  are  hexadecimal  numbers   (or 
symbols).


     DIR

          The  'DIR'  command causes ELINKS to run the  operating 
system DIR function.


     < batfile

          The '<' command is used to temporarily re-direct ELINKS 
input to the named batch file.  Any emulator command may be given 
in this batch file, except for the '<' command.

          A  '<'  command in a batch file causes ELINKS to  pause 
until a carriage-return is typed on the keyboard.

          Typing  carriage-return while a pause is not in  effect 
will abort batch file processing.

          The  batch  file name is a  standard  file  name.   The 
default extent for a batch file is ".BAT".


     + outfile

          The  '+'  command  causes  all emulator  output  to  be 
written  to  the  named file,  in addition to  appearing  on  the 
screen.

          Output  to the '+' file continues until a new '+'  file 
is opened,  or a '+' is entered by itself on a line (this  closes 
the current '+' file without opening a new one).

          It  is recommended that any '+' files be closed  before 
exiting ELINKS with 'Ctrl-Break'.

          The outfile name is a standard file name.   No  default 
extent is assumed.


     I. symfile

          The 'I.' command causes ELINKS to read the named symbol 
file into its internal symbol table.

          The  symbol  file name is a standard  file  name.   The 
default extent is ".SYM".

          This  command  can  be given by default on  the  ELINKS 
command line.

          'I.' given without a symbol file name causes an  "ERROR 
IN  OPEN" message,  and erases the current contents of the ELINKS 
internal symbol table.


     I.. symfile

          The  'I..'  command  causes ELINKS to  read  the  named 
symbol  file  and append its contents to the current contents  of 
its internal symbol table.


     W. symfile

          The  'W.'  command causes ELINKS to  write  the  edited 
contents of its internal symbol table to the named symbol file.


     .

          '.'  commands  are used for editing and displaying  the 
contents of the ELINKS internal symbol table.

          A  '.'  given  on the command  line  causes  ELINKS  to 
display the contents of its internal symbol table.


     .symbol

          A  '.'  command followed by a symbol causes  ELINKS  to 
display  the contents of its internal symbol table,  starting  at 
'symbol'.


     .symbol=

          A '.' command, followed by a symbol, followed by an '=' 
causes  ELINKS to erase the named symbol from its internal symbol 
table.


     .symbol=value

          This  command  causes  ELINKS  to  assign  'value'   to 
'symbol'.

          If 'symbol' already exists, it is revalued.

          If symbol does not exist,  it is appended to the symbol 
table, and assigned the value 'value'.

          'value' is an hexadecimal number.



Notes on symbols:

     ELINKS defines a symbol as either a label,  or a module path 
followed by a label.

     The  ELINKS  iternal  symbol  table contains  two  types  of 
entries:  labels and modules.

     To use an ordinary label in a command, use ".label".

     To  use  a  module  path  to  reach  a  certain  label,  use 
".module/label" (i.e. L.STARTMOD/START).

     Using a module path will move the named module to the top of 
the symbol table,  and then search the symbol table for the named 
label.   This  places the last pathed module first in the  search 
order for subsequent symbol manipulation operations.

     Modules cannot be editing with the ELINKS '.' commands.

     If  a  label is added to the internal symbol table with  the 
".symbol=value"  command,  and that symbol contains a  path;  the 
label  will be added after the module named in the  path,  rather 
than at the end of the symbol table.


Notes for 8088/8086 users:

     Labels  on  the  8088/8086 emulator may have  values  beyond 
those associated with normal 8-bit processors.

     For the 8088/8086, label values may take on the forms:

          ssss:oooo      ; Segment:Offset (20-bit value)
          CS:oooo        ; Segment_Register:Offset (20-bit value)
          DS:oooo
          ES:oooo
          SS:oooo
          oooo           ; Offset only (Ordinary 16-bit value)

     Label forms "ssss:oooo" and "oooo" are fixed values.  Labels 
defined  with a segment register have values which vary according 
to the current contents of the 8088/8086 segment registers.


     The  following  labels have special meaning to  ELINKS  when 
used with the 8088/8086,  and should not be used in ANY  assembly 
language program:

     _Aorg_    _Corg_    _Dorg_    _Eorg_    _Sorg_    _Uorg_
     _Aend_    _Cend_    _Dend_    _Eend_    _Send_    _Uend_
