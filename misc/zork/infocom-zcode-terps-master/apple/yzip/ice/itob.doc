
        INTEL HEX FILE TO BINARY FILE CONVERSION PROGRAM


Supplied on your master disk are the following two files:

     ITOB.COM  Intel HEX file to Binary file conversion program.

     ITOB.DOC  This file.


ITOB:

     The ITOB command line is formatted as follows:

     ITOB Hex_filename [Binary_filename] [-Base_address_override]


     ITOB                     Name of the conversion program.
     Hex_filename             Name of the Intel Hex file to 
                              convert.
     Binary_filename          Optional.  Name of the binary 
                              output file.
     -Base_address_override   Optional.  Value to assume as the 
                              base address of the input hex file.


     The extent of the Hex_filename defaults to ".HEX" if it is 
not given on the command line.

     The extent of the Binary_filename defaults to ".BIN" if it 
is not given on the command line.

     If a Binary_filename is not given on the command line, the 
name of the binary output file defaults to the Hex_filename, with 
the extent ".BIN".

     If the -Base_address_override is not given, ITOB will take 
the lowest-addressed byte in the Intel hex file and write this 
byte as the first byte of the binary output file.

     If the -Base_address_override is given, ITOB will assume the 
lowest-addressed byte in the Intel hex file is at the 
Base_address_override value.

     If the -Base_address_override specifies a value which is 
greater than the actual lowest-addressed byte in the Intel hex 
file, a warning message will be issued.  The bytes in the hex 
file below the Base_address_override value will be discarded.

     If the Intel hex file contains "holes" in the hex records, 
these holes will be filled in with 0FFH bytes in the binary 
output file.


Examples:
          ITOB HEXFILE                  ; Convert HEXFILE.HEX 
                                        ;  into HEXFILE.BIN
          ITOB HEXFILE.HXE              ; Convert HEXFILE.HXE 
                                        ;  into HEXFILE.BIN
          ITOB HEXFILE BINFILE          ; Convert HEXFILE.HEX 
                                        ;  into BINFILE.BIN
          ITOB HEXFILE BINFILE.COM      ; Convert HEXFILE.HEX 
                                        ;  into BINFILE.COM
          ITOB HEXFILE -0               ; Convert HEXFILE.HEX 
                                        ;  into HEXFILE.BIN with 
                                        ;  the binary base 
                                        ;  address set to 0
          ITOB HEXFILE BINFILE -F000    ; All options used
