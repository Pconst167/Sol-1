C128 Requirements for:

Alternate character sets:

The first character must be 32 (GOFF must be 32 or greater).
The number of characters can therefore only be up to 96 (GCOUNT must be 96 
or less).
The GSIZE must be 8 x 8. Any other configuration is unmanagable.

Two alternate character sets are possible. They must be created as two 
separate file, both of which will be loaded into character memory at the 
start of the game. Neither set can be expected to be displayed while the 
output is in inverse mode. Any inverse of a char you wish must be explicitly 
included in the character sets. 



There is no capability for picture files.



COLOR is possible. All the colors mentioned in the spec may be used for both 
the foreground and the background, however, while all the colors may appear 
on the screen together at once as the foreground, only 1 color at a time may 
be the background color. Changing the background color will cause the entire 
screen background to change to that color.
