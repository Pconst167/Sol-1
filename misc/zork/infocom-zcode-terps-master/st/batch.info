HOW TO BUILD XZIP FOR THE ATARI ST (USING LATTICE C/ASM)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [] Run INIT.BAT to set up a 250K ramdisk as drive E.  The ramdisk
     speeds up turnaround time and eliminates the disk thrashing caused
     by frequent alternating reads and writes.

  [] Enter the \XZIP\ directory

	LA_R  STX	(assemble 68K source)

	LC_R  XZIP	(compile and assemble, C source)

	LLNOS_R  XZIP	(link, with no symbols)
  or	LL_R  XZIP	(link, with symbols)

  [] When running the interpreter, note that it looks for the following
     data files:

	STORY.DAT	(the game)
	FONT2.DAT	(picture library, optional)
	FONT3.DAT	(alternate character set, optional)


HOW TO BUILD ZIP/EZIP FOR THE ATARI ST (USING ATARI C/ASM)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  [] Enter the \NC\ directory

	ZCA \NW\ZIP	(compile and assemble, C sources)

	ZA  \NW\ST	(make sure flag in source is set for ZIP or EZIP)

  [] Copy the two .O files from \NW\ to \NL\

     The linker won't work with .O files outside its own directory.
     I used a separate directory because of the large number of files.

  [] Enter the \NL\ directory

	ZLRNOS ZIP	(link and relocate, with no symbols)

  [] Copy ZIP.PRG to wherever the data file is (STORY.DAT).  If the 
     interpreter is actually EZIP, rename it at this time.
