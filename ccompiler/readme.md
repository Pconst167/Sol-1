This is a C Compielr for the Sol-1 CPU/MiniComputer.

It supports most features of the C language, including matrices, pointers, enums, structs, etc. 
At the moment floating point is not implemented, but it will be at some point.
It also lacks a real pre-processor.

Apart from that it is a nicely working C compiler that will generate pure assembly code for the Sol-1 CPU. The TASM assembler is then used to assemble the code into binary.
At some point the assembling will be done directly.
